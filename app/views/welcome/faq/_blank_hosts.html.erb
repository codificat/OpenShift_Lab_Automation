Yes, you can deploy blank Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts.<br><br>

To do so, add a new instance to a project. Under 'Types', select only "Blank host". This will ensure that when the instance is deployed, it will only go through the necessary post-install set up to allow you to ssh to the box as root. The box will also be registered via RHSM to the Red Hat Employee Subscription.
