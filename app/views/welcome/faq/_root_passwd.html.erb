The root password for each instance will only be available if you are logged into the Red Hat Corporate SSO. This way, it is unlikely the lab will be disturbed by any non-RH employee.<br><br>

It would be unfortunate for someone to create a complex reproducer, just for someone to come through and break it because they know the root password. It is also a security risk to show root passwords of machines in the lab environment to anyone on the network.
