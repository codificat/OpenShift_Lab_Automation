To 'Check out' an OpenShift lab will give you access to modify the lab in its entirety.<br><br>

You can add new instances, save a template, redeploy, edit specific instances, and even change default passwords. If you do not have an instance checked out, you will only be able to see the basic configuration. You cannot make any changes to an OpenShift lab you do not have checked out.<br><br>

There is currently no time limit when an OpenShift Lab is checked out. Please be sure to Un-check out a lab when you are finished.
