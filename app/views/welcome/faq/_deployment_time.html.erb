It depends on how large the environment being deployed is.<br><br>
Generally, if you are utilizing an HA deployment of at least 3 datastores and at least 2 activemq instances, the deployment will take about 35 minutes. This is because the deployment goes through the actual steps a customer would to install the OpenShift system.<br><br>
Smaller instances, such as one broker, one datastore/activemq system, and one node, will take much less time to deploy.
