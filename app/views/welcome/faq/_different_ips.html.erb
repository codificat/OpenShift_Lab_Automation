When a template is saved, it is made to be used with any OpenShift lab environment. Because each environment has a specific set of IP addresses (dictacted by the OpenStack backend), we cannot save the IP addresses into the template. If we did, you would only be able to apply that template to the same OpenShift lab environment.
